      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        At CO2 LOW (NPC), we are committed to supporting holistic well-being in our communities. As part of this mission, we regularly assess multi-dimensional poverty among the families and individuals in our network. The Greenlight Baseline Assessment conducted in Tongaat, KwaZulu-Natal, in November 2024, provides valuable insights into the daily realities of socio-economic hardship, with the aim to inform and inspire impactful action.

      <h2>What is Greenlight?</h2>
      <p>
        Greenlight is a comprehensive, self-evaluation tool that measures quality of life through six critical dimensions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Income &amp; Employment</li>
        <li>Health &amp; Environment</li>
        <li>Housing &amp; Infrastructure</li>
        <li>Education &amp; Culture</li>
        <li>Organisation &amp; Participation</li>
        <li>Self-Awareness &amp; Motivation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each household rates itself on 50 unique indicators within these areas, guiding both self-understanding and targeted support strategies.

      <p>
        <strong>Income &amp; Employment</strong> and <strong>Housing &amp; Infrastructure</strong> are particularly severe areas of deprivation.
      </p>

      <h3>Most Critical Challenges</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stable employment and income sources:</strong> 0% doing well; 80% stuck</li>
        <li><strong>Access to credit facilities:</strong> 9% doing well; 84% stuck</li>
        <li><strong>Family savings:</strong> 9% doing well; 77% stuck</li>
        <li><strong>Income above the poverty line:</strong> 8% doing well; 73% stuck</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Only 8% feel secure, with 63% in “stuck” status</li>
        <li><strong>Sanitation and sewerage, clothing, garbage disposal, transport, budgeting, and healthcare</strong> are also among the hardest-hit areas.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Voices from the Community</h4>
      <blockquote>
        “Total Family Income: R2,000... food and clothing is an issue. Not enough money to support the family. Lack of money also causes frustration and fighting in the house.”
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        “Six adults not working. Able to work but can’t go and look as they live too far from the town and no money for transport.”
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        “Worried about their child’s future and the quality of education being very bad.”
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Areas of Strength</h3>
      <p>Despite challenges, some strengths emerged:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal identification:</strong> 95% doing well</li>
        <li><strong>Registered to vote:</strong> 89% doing well</li>
        <li><strong>Moral values, self-confidence, and emotional awareness:</strong> Over 75% doing well</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Root Causes and Barriers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Transport:</strong> Distance and cost to search for work are major barriers.</li>
        <li><strong>Education:</strong> Poor English literacy and low education levels impact employment prospects.</li>
        <li><strong>Water and Health:</strong> Safe drinking water and consistent healthcare remain concerns.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Exclusion:</strong> Lack of access to savings, credit, and reliable income.</li>
        <li><strong>Overcrowding:</strong> Insecure housing and lack of privacy/stable home environments.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Hopes and Aspirations</h3>
      <p>
        Many participants—while expressing deep frustration—still dream of a better future. Common hopes include steady jobs, safe homes, access to water and electricity, and the means to start or grow small businesses.
