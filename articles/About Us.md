# About Us

## Turning Waste Into Opportunity

**CO₂ LOW (NPC)** is a South African non-profit pioneering practical, scalable solutions for food security, climate action, and community empowerment. Driven by a commitment to sustainability, we transform food and organic waste into resources that power regenerative agriculture, create meaningful jobs, and build resilient local economies.

### Who We Are

Founded by Anban Pillay, CO₂ LOW is a team of passionate change-makers, agricultural innovators, and community leaders committed to driving impact from the ground up. Based in eThekwini Municipality, KwaZulu-Natal, we deliver holistic programs that bridge business, environmental, and social needs, working closely with rural farmers, youth, and industry partners.

### What Makes Us Different

- **End-to-End Circular Solutions:** We process food waste locally, slashing landfill and logistics costs while creating nutrient-rich compost, animal feed, renewable energy, and affordable, fresh food.
- **Climate Action \& Regeneration:** Our methods—from composting and biochar, to black soldier fly farming and biogas—capture carbon, restore soil health, and safeguard biodiversity.
- **Community at the Core:** By empowering local farmers and youth with training, jobs, and market access, we foster economic growth, self-sufficiency, and stronger communities.
- **Pioneering the Circular Economy:** We design closed-loop models where waste becomes value, supporting both businesses and underserved communities.
