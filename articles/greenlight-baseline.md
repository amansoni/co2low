# Understanding Poverty: Greenlight Baseline Assessment 2024

## Introduction

At CO2 LOW (NPC), we are committed to supporting holistic well-being in our communities. As part of this mission, we regularly assess multi-dimensional poverty among the families and individuals in our network. The Greenlight Baseline Assessment conducted in Tongaat, KwaZulu-Natal, in November 2024, provides valuable insights into the daily realities of socio-economic hardship, with the aim to inform and inspire impactful action.

## What is Greenlight?

Greenlight is a comprehensive, self-evaluation tool that measures quality of life through six critical dimensions:

- Income \& Employment
- Health \& Environment
- Housing \& Infrastructure
- Education \& Culture
- Organisation \& Participation
- Self-Awareness \& Motivation

Each household rates itself on 50 unique indicators within these areas, guiding both self-understanding and targeted support strategies.

## Who Was Surveyed?

- **Location:** Tongaat, KZN, South Africa
- **Date:** November 2024
- **Participants:** 88 individuals
- **Survey Type:** Baseline poverty survey


## Key Findings

### Average Household Status

| Category | Number | Percentage |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Doing well | 19 | 38% |
| Struggling but trying | 20 | 40% |
| Stuck | 11 | 22% |

These results point to severe poverty, with only 38% of households reporting relative stability.

### Dimension Performance

| Dimension | Doing Well | Struggling | Stuck |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Income \& Employment | 24% | 13% | 63% |
| Health \& Environment | 38% | 47% | 15% |
| Housing \& Infrastructure | 19% | 45% | 36% |
| Education \& Culture | 39% | 51% | 10% |
| Organisation \& Participation | 78% | 20% | 2% |
| Self-Awareness \& Motivation | 69% | 26% | 5% |

**Income \& Employment** and **Housing \& Infrastructure** are particularly severe areas of deprivation.

### Most Critical Challenges

- **Stable employment and income sources:** 0% doing well; 80% stuck
- **Access to credit facilities:** 9% doing well; 84% stuck
- **Family savings:** 9% doing well; 77% stuck
- **Income above the poverty line:** 8% doing well; 73% stuck
- **Security:** Only 8% feel secure, with 63% in “stuck” status
- **Sanitation and sewerage, clothing, garbage disposal, transport, budgeting, and healthcare** are also among the hardest-hit areas.


#### Voices from the Community

> “Total Family Income: R2,000... food and clothing is an issue. Not enough money to support the family. Lack of money also causes frustration and fighting in the house.”

> “Six adults not working. Able to work but can’t go and look as they live too far from the town and no money for transport.”

> “Worried about their child’s future and the quality of education being very bad.”

### Areas of Strength

Despite challenges, some strengths emerged:

- **Personal identification:** 95% doing well
- **Registered to vote:** 89% doing well
- **Moral values, self-confidence, and emotional awareness:** Over 75% doing well


### Root Causes and Barriers

- **Transport**: Distance and cost to search for work are major barriers.
- **Education**: Poor English literacy and low education levels impact employment prospects.
- **Water and Health**: Safe drinking water and consistent healthcare remain concerns.
- **Financial Exclusion**: Lack of access to savings, credit, and reliable income.
- **Overcrowding**: Insecure housing and lack of privacy/stable home environments.


### Hopes and Aspirations

Many participants—while expressing deep frustration—still dream of a better future. Common hopes include steady jobs, safe homes, access to water and electricity, and the means to start or grow small businesses.

## Why It Matters

Understanding these realities allows CO2 LOW (NPC) and partners to:

- Target interventions where the need is greatest
- Empower families through personalized, strengths-based strategies
- Advocate for systemic change and policy improvements in our region


## Conclusion

This baseline assessment is a call to action for all stakeholders—government, business, civic sector, and the broader community—to work together in breaking the cycle of poverty. By leveraging Greenlight insights, we can help families move from “stuck,” to “struggling but trying,” to “doing well”—restoring dignity and hope for the future[^1].
